Certainly! Below is an example of a `Miner` class for mining blocks in a blockchain:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.Security.Cryptography;
using System.Text;

namespace Future
{
    public class Miner
    {
        private readonly int _difficulty;

        public Miner(int difficulty)
        {
            _difficulty = difficulty;
        }

        public Block Mine(Block block)
        {
            Stopwatch stopwatch = new Stopwatch();
            stopwatch.Start();

            while (true)
            {
                string hash = CalculateHash(block);
                if (IsHashValid(hash))
                {
                    stopwatch.Stop();
                    Console.WriteLine($"Block mined successfully in {stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds} milliseconds");
                    block.Hash = hash;
                    return block;
                }
                block.Nonce++;
            }
        }

        private string CalculateHash(Block block)
        {
            using (SHA256 sha256 = SHA256.Create())
            {
                byte[] inputBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes($"{block.Index}-{block.Timestamp}-{block.Data}-{block.PreviousHash}-{block.Nonce}");
                byte[] outputBytes = sha256.ComputeHash(inputBytes);
                return Convert.ToBase64String(outputBytes);
            }
        }

        private bool IsHashValid(string hash)
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < _difficulty; i++)
            {
                if (hash[i] != '0')
                {
                    return false;
                }
            }
            return true;
        }
    }
}
```

Explanation of the `Miner` class:

1. **Fields**:
   - `_difficulty`: Represents the mining difficulty level. It determines how hard it is to find a valid hash.

2. **Constructor**:
   - Initializes the miner with the desired difficulty level.

3. **Mine() Method**:
   - Takes a block as input and attempts to mine it.
   - Continuously calculates hashes for the block, adjusting the nonce until a valid hash is found.
   - Once a valid hash is found, updates the block's hash with the valid hash and returns the mined block.

4. **CalculateHash() Method**:
   - Calculates the hash of a block using SHA-256 hashing algorithm.

5. **IsHashValid() Method**:
   - Checks if the calculated hash meets the difficulty criteria (e.g., starts with a certain number of leading zeros).

This `Miner` class can be used to simulate the mining process in a blockchain. Adjusting the difficulty level allows you to control the mining complexity and the rate at which new blocks are added to the blockchain.
