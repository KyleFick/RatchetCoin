An integration class typically facilitates communication and interaction between different components or systems. In the context of a blockchain application, an integration class could handle interactions with external services, databases, or APIs. Below is a basic example of an `Integration` class:

```csharp
using System;

namespace Future
{
    public class Integration
    {
        // Example method for integrating with an external service
        public void SendDataToExternalService(string data)
        {
            // Code for sending data to an external service
            Console.WriteLine($"Sending data to external service: {data}");
        }

        // Example method for integrating with a database
        public void SaveDataToDatabase(string data)
        {
            // Code for saving data to a database
            Console.WriteLine($"Saving data to database: {data}");
        }

        // Example method for integrating with an API
        public void CallExternalAPI(string endpoint)
        {
            // Code for calling an external API
            Console.WriteLine($"Calling external API: {endpoint}");
        }
    }
}
```

Explanation of the `Integration` class:

1. **SendDataToExternalService() Method**:
   - Example method for sending data to an external service. You would replace the placeholder implementation with code to interact with the actual external service.

2. **SaveDataToDatabase() Method**:
   - Example method for saving data to a database. You would replace the placeholder implementation with code to interact with the actual database.

3. **CallExternalAPI() Method**:
   - Example method for calling an external API. You would replace the placeholder implementation with code to interact with the actual API.

This `Integration` class provides basic functionalities for integrating a blockchain application with external services, databases, or APIs. Depending on your specific requirements, you can extend this class to include additional integration methods or integrate with more complex external systems. Additionally, you may handle error handling, authentication, and other aspects of integration within this class or its associated components.
