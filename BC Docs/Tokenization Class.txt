Here's an example of a `Tokenization` class that provides basic functionalities for creating and managing tokens within a blockchain:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace Future
{
    public class Tokenization
    {
        private Dictionary<string, decimal> _balances;

        public Tokenization()
        {
            _balances = new Dictionary<string, decimal>();
        }

        public void Initialize(Dictionary<string, decimal> initialBalances)
        {
            _balances = initialBalances;
        }

        public void Transfer(string sender, string recipient, decimal amount)
        {
            if (!_balances.ContainsKey(sender) || !_balances.ContainsKey(recipient))
            {
                throw new InvalidOperationException("Sender or recipient not found.");
            }

            if (_balances[sender] < amount)
            {
                throw new InvalidOperationException("Insufficient balance.");
            }

            _balances[sender] -= amount;
            _balances[recipient] += amount;
        }

        public decimal GetBalance(string address)
        {
            if (!_balances.ContainsKey(address))
            {
                throw new InvalidOperationException("Address not found.");
            }

            return _balances[address];
        }
    }
}
```

Explanation of the `Tokenization` class:

1. **Fields**:
   - `_balances`: Dictionary to store the balances of token holders.

2. **Constructor**:
   - Initializes the `_balances` dictionary.

3. **Initialize() Method**:
   - Initializes the tokenization system with initial token balances for addresses.

4. **Transfer() Method**:
   - Allows transferring tokens from one address to another.
   - Checks if the sender has sufficient balance before transferring.

5. **GetBalance() Method**:
   - Retrieves the token balance of a specific address.

This `Tokenization` class offers basic functionalities for creating and managing tokens within a blockchain. You can further extend this class to include additional features such as token issuance, burning, freezing, or implementing more complex token standards like ERC-20 or ERC-721. Additionally, you may integrate this class with other components of your blockchain system to ensure token transactions are recorded and validated immutably.
