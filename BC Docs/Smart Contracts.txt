Creating a class for smart contracts involves defining the structure and functionality of contracts that can be executed on a blockchain. Here's an example of a simple `SmartContract` class:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace Future
{
    public class SmartContract
    {
        private Dictionary<string, decimal> _balances;

        public SmartContract()
        {
            _balances = new Dictionary<string, decimal>();
        }

        public void Initialize(Dictionary<string, decimal> initialBalances)
        {
            _balances = initialBalances;
        }

        public void Transfer(string sender, string recipient, decimal amount)
        {
            if (!_balances.ContainsKey(sender) || !_balances.ContainsKey(recipient))
            {
                throw new InvalidOperationException("Sender or recipient not found.");
            }

            if (_balances[sender] < amount)
            {
                throw new InvalidOperationException("Insufficient balance.");
            }

            _balances[sender] -= amount;
            _balances[recipient] += amount;
        }

        public decimal GetBalance(string address)
        {
            if (!_balances.ContainsKey(address))
            {
                throw new InvalidOperationException("Address not found.");
            }

            return _balances[address];
        }
    }
}
```

Explanation of the `SmartContract` class:

1. **Fields**:
   - `_balances`: Dictionary to store the balances of addresses.

2. **Constructor**:
   - Initializes the `_balances` dictionary.

3. **Initialize() Method**:
   - Initializes the smart contract with initial balances for addresses.

4. **Transfer() Method**:
   - Allows transferring funds from one address to another.
   - Checks if the sender has sufficient balance before transferring.

5. **GetBalance() Method**:
   - Retrieves the balance of a specific address.

This `SmartContract` class provides basic functionality for managing token balances and transfers. In a real-world scenario, you would extend this class with additional features and logic specific to your smart contract requirements. Additionally, you might want to implement security measures, access controls, event logging, and other advanced functionalities based on the complexity of your smart contract application.
